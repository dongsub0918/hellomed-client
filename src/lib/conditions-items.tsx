      answer: `The symptoms of a cold and the flu can be similar. Both conditions are common respiratory illnesses but are the result of different viruses.

      question: "What is the difference between a cold and the flu?",
      answer: `Cold symptoms are typically milder than flu symptoms and involve a stuffy or runny nose, cough, and fever. Cold symptoms usually don’t evolve into more serious health complications. Flu symptoms can mimic cold symptoms and are more severe. They may include:
        
        - Chills
        - Sore throat
        - Muscle aches
        - Headaches
        - Fatigue

        Flu symptoms can range from mild to severe, and in some cases, can even result in death without treatment. Recovery from the flu can take several days to several weeks. Complications of the flu may include:
        
        - Sinus or ear infections
        - Asthma
        - Inflammation of the heart or brain
        - Organ failure
        - Sepsis`,

      question: "What treatments are available for colds and flu?",
      answer: `If your doctor at HELLOMED determines you have a cold, they may recommend over-the-counter cold relieving medications to improve your breathing and reduce any fever. Colds typically resolve in a few days. If a fever remains or symptoms worsen, let your doctor know immediately.
        
      If your doctor determines you have the flu, they recommend lots of rest. You also need to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Your doctor may recommend medications to treat symptoms and body aches. They may also prescribe antiviral drugs to reduce the duration of your flu symptoms, and request that you avoid going to work or school until you recover.`,
